# resonateContact

Summary

The web application is a contact directory using React.js to render the app. The app uses axios to
grab random contact information from a source and using setStates to map the contacts and render an
array of contact cards. Each card displays the name and number of each contact. There is an additional
button on each contact card labelled "more info" that when clicked will trigger a modal event that
displays extra information related to that contact.
Additional functions include a search bar where the user can type a name and it will isolate that contact.
This function is case sensitive at the moment but given more time to develop the app will fix this. Also,
if you click on the name title at the top of the list of contacts the app will sort through the contacts in
alphabetical order. The application is responsive and adjust depending on which device is been used.

The following npm's and methods where used in the development of the application:
- axios
- bootstrap
- Procfile
- prop-types
- dotenv
- express
- body-parser
- path
